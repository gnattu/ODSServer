ODS basically uses http range requests to fetch blocks off a disk
image which is advertised via mdns.

just run the server and then use the following to advertise a disk
image on a lunix box:

avahi-publish -s HOSTNAME _odisk._tcp 65432 \
    "disk2s0=adVN=DiskImage,adVT=public.cd-media" \
    "sys=waMA=A4:BA:DB:E7:89:CD,adVF=0x4,adDT=0x3,adCC=1"

im sure people on other platforms can figure the equivilent out.

when the mdns npm module is updated to build against node 0.6 i'll
add support for the server to publish its own mdns records.
